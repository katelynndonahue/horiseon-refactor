# horiseon-refactor
# <Your-Project-Title>
## Description
I worked with my tutor to help me to better understand the basics of html and css. It clarified much of what I have struggled with and I believe that this revision is much more acceptable to the requirements.
- My motivation for this project is to  broaded my exposure to refactors, repos and basic html and css.
- I built this as practice to create a refactor, repo and make necessary revisions to html and css.
- It is supposed to be more user friendly, specifically to those with special needs or disabilities that might need enhanced or altered functionality to accompany their specific needs.
## Installation
- Create new repository using Github, with short but memorable name, making it public and with a READ.me.
- Click green Code button to copy SSH key to clone into your terminal or Gitbash, for Windows.
- Using the terminal or Gitbash, ensure that you are on correct directory before creating your repository. Once in the correct folder, you will do a: 
git status
Evaluate the results and follow suggested next steps. If nothing is needed to be added or commited, you may proceed to use:
git clone (the link that you copied for your repository):
git status:
git push origin main, to content to Github.
